          <h3>Smart Wearable Device For Child Safety</h3>
          <p>
            Security is a major important criteria in various sectors and for
            various situations. We constantly view and hear news about
            children’s getting kidnaped, and are subjected to various
            harassments. <br /><br />
            So in-order to break the claim, we propose a system where the infant
            is continuously monitored and the safety is ensured. The data’s are
            constantly updated to the server and parents can monitor the child
            using the child’s IOT credentials.<br />
            <br />When the child wearable is out of range, then the alarm will
            turn on notifying that the infant is in danger.
